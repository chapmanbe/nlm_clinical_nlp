    "RadNLP is a package that builds upon the [pyConTextNLP]() algorithm's sentence-level text processing to perform simple document-level classification. The package also contains a number of functions for identifying sections of reports, identifing and eliminating boiler-plate text, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will demonstrate radnlp's most basic functionality: given a text of interest create an overall document classification. The classifiction uses a simple maximum function: for each concept marked in a report the maximal schema value occurance is selected to characterize the report for that concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report Schema and *maximal value*\n",
    "\n",
    "The document classification is based on schema that combines multiple concepts (e.g. existence, certitude, severity) into a single ordinal scale. The RadNLP GitHub repository includes a knowledge base directory (KBs) contains the schema we ahve previously developed for critical findings projects. It is included below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Lines that start with the # symbol are comments and are ignored\n",
    "# The schema consists of a numeric value, followed by a label (e.g. \"AMBIVALENT\"), \n",
    "# followed by a Python express that can evaluate to True or False\n",
    "# The Python expression uses LABELS from the rules. processReports.py will substitute \n",
    "# the LABEL with any matched values identified from \n",
    "# the corresponding rules\n",
    "1,AMBIVALENT,DISEASE_STATE == 2\n",
    "2,Negative/Certain/Acute,DISEASE_STATE == 0 and CERTAINTY_STATE == 1\n",
    "3,Negative/Uncertain/Chronic,DISEASE_STATE == 0 and CERTAINTY_STATE == 0 and ACUTE_STATE == 0\n",
    "4,Positive/Uncertain/Chronic,DISEASE_STATE == 1 and CERTAINTY_STATE == 0 and ACUTE_STATE == 0 \n",

    "## ``radnlp`` Rules\n",

    "``radnlp`` uses rule files to specify rules that define how particular pyConTextNLP findings relate to radnlp concepts. For example, in the ``classificationRules3.csv`` provided in KBs, we provide a rules that state:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default disease state is 1. \n",
    "* ``PROBABLE_EXISTENCE`` AND  ``DEFINITE_EXISTENCE`` map to a disease state of 1\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We currently support three rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``CLASSIFICAITON_RULE``: these are the rules that relate to disease, temporality, and certainty\n",
    "1. ``CATEGORY_RULE``: these are only partially developed concepts that attempt to address combinatorics problems in pyConTextNLP by making default findings more general (e.g. ``infaract``) and then tries to create more specific findings by attaching anatomic locations to the findings (e.g. an ``infarct`` becomes a critical finding when attached to an anatomic concept like ``brain_anatomy`` or ``heart_anatomy``.\n",
    "1. ``SEVERITY_RULE``: Again, not fully developed but relates to extracting severity concepts (e.g. ``large`` or 4.3 cm).\n"
